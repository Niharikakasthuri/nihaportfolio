            &emsp;&emsp;My name is Niharika Kasthuri. I am from Kakinada, Andra Pradesh. I have completed BSC
            in Computer Science from Mohan Degree College, Kakinada in 2022. I am currently pursuing MBA in HR & Marketing.<br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;After graduation I took a year to prepare for competitive exams. However after 
        seeing the opportunities in the IT filed, I decided to shift my career. I began 
        exploring courses where I could learn the necessary skills.<br/>
        &emsp;&emsp;I came across a program at Nxtwave and joined. Where I have been learning the necessary 
        technologies continuously and upskilling myself to succeed in this field.<br/>
        &emsp;&emsp;I have learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs, ReactJs, MongoDB. I've developed a Todo list using 
        ReactJs and also developed some other projects. I'm eager to build a strong career in the IT industry and continue to learn and grow.
